# Marimo notebooks

## Usage

I used `pipenv` for this, but I imagine `uv` would work as well.

With `pipenv` or another Python package / virtualenv manager installed:
```sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv run marimo edit lone_arrivals_esomr_mdftf.py  # Or another notebook, if I eventually add others to this repo
```

Marimo should open a browser tab to the notebook.

For lone_arrivals_esomr_mdftf.py, you may want to use "app view" to hide all the code and get a form-like interface.\
You can switch to "app view" by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> or clicking this button:\
